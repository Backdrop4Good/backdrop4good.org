Pretty in Purple
======================

Pretty in Purple is a very basic blog theme with purple accents.

Installation
------------

- Install this theme using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  hhttp://cssglobe.com/pure-css3-post-tags

- If you desire, you can add additional CSS into the style.css file. That file
  will not be updated in future versions of this theme. Note that it is not a
  best practice to modify any files within a contributed project (because it is
  very easy to accidentally overwrite them). Do so at your own risk.
